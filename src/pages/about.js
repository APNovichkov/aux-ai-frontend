            Aux.ai was born when I first saw the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UwLhqcZqxc">Travis Scott AI</a> video. I was fascinated by what was possible with AI, and having studied Data Science and Deep Learning at my university, I wanted to take a shot at this problem.{" "}
             
            <span className="about-us-main-text-highlight">
            {" "}Aux.ai lets you generate music of different lengths in the style of different composers and play the result right in the application.
            </span>{" "}
            The model which Aux.ai is based on is an LSTM model, and has 2 LSTM layers, 1 Attention layer, and 2 Dense layers. The model was trained on hundreds MIDI music files of different pieces by Chopin, Rachmaninov and Tchaikovsky. 
            This is the first version of this project, and I am looking into using a true attention model in the future, as well as adding more composers and styles!
            <br />
            <br />
            I hope you get the chance to check out the project, and if you want, support its development.<br />
            Happy Creating!! ðŸš€
